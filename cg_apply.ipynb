Unemployment would go under 6.5% in April of 2014. Unemployment was 4.8% in October of 2016 and was 4.4% in June 2017 up from 4.3%.  \\n\\nBTW the Dow hit 22,000 today. On 11/8/2016, the DJIA closed at 18,259.60. So the Dow has increased more than 3,700+ points in 8 months. Irrational exuberance?

I am not particularly blaming the teachers, but the system is not working.  Most of that failure rests with the parents and there is little the system can do to fix that.

In Hawaii, with the overthrow of the Kingdom in 1893 and the following annexation in 1898, the Hawaiian language was entirely banned from schools and government, and discouraged elsewhere.

       "843   Williams and Holleman, This is the path to social promotion. The mean reading level of Anchorage high school graduates is seventh grade.  For mathematics it is sixth grade. The UA system spends an inordinate amount of time and money on remedial education because our high school graduates are not prepared for college work.  I am not particularly blaming the teachers, but the system is not working.  Most of that failure rests with the parents and there is little the system can do to fix that. If our public school system were a business it would have been forced to shut down decades ago. So instead of tinkering with standardized graduation testing let's improve results for those that are capable and motivated.   \n",
